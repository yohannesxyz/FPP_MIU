This is the general case of the problem
All 3 classes are in different packages.

                 SuperClass
                     ^
                     |
            -------------------
            |                  |
            
        CallingClass        ObjRefClass
        
Method in CallingClass tries to use an instance of 
ObjRefClass to access a protected method in SuperClass.
Compiler Error.

Three ways to fix:

1) Make ObjRefClass a subclass of Calling Class
2) Put CallingClass in same package as SuperClass (doesn't
even need to be a subclass of Superclass in that case)
3) Override the protected method in ObjRefClass
