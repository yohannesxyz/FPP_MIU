/*
 * Use SampleClass to guide you as you try to write a program that
 * prints the following lines to the console:
 
        The product of the values in {2, 5, -3, 11, 1} is -330
        A printout of the array of integers is [2, 5, -3, 11, 1]
        Concatenating the strings in arr2 gives us: ALMOST DONE
   
   Obtain the first line by creating a method 
           static int product(int[] arr)
   which multiplies together every element of arr.
   Your printed statement should include the value returned by the method product(int[] arr)
   
   Obtain the second line by using the technique in SampleClass to
   print an array of values
   
   Obtain the third line by defining an array of strings and passing
   it to a method of the form
           static String concatenate(String[] arr2)
   which concatenates all the elements of arr and returns the resulting
   String. Then print this returned value.
